## Part I: Explore Word Embedding (15%)

Word embeddings are useful representation of words that capture information about word meaning as well as location. They are used as a fundamental component for downstream NLP tasks, e.g., text classification. In this part, we will explore the embeddings produced by [GloVe (global vectors for word representation)](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). It is simlar to Word2Vec but differs in their underlying methodology: in GloVe, word embeddings are learned based on global word-word co-occurrence statistics. Both Word2Vec and GloVe tend to produce vector-space embeddings that perform similarly in downstream NLP tasks.

We first load the GloVe vectors


import gensim.downloader as api
# download the model and return as object ready for use
glove_word_vectors = api.load('glove-wiki-gigaword-100')

"""Take a look at the vocabulary size and dimensionality of the embedding space"""

print('vocabulary size = ', len(glove_word_vectors.index_to_key))
print('embedding dimensionality = ', glove_word_vectors['happy'].shape)



# Check word embedding for 'happy'
# You can access the embedding of a word with glove_word_vectors[word] if word
# is in the vocabulary
glove_word_vectors['happy']

"""With word embeddings learned from GloVe or Word2Vec, words with similar semantic meanings tend to have vectors that are close together. Please code and calculate the **cosine similarities** between words based on their embeddings (i.e., word vectors).

For each of the following words in occupation, compute its cosine similarty to 'woman' and its similarity to 'man' and check which gender is more similar.

"""## Part II Understand contextual word embedding using BERT (15%)

A big difference between Word2Vec and BERT is that Word2Vec learns context-free word representations, i.e., the embedding for 'orange' is the same in "I love eating oranges" and in "The sky turned orange". BERT, on the other hand, produces contextual word presentations, i.e., embeddings for the same word in different contexts are different.

For example, let us compare the context-based embedding vectors for 'orange' in the following three sentences using Bert:
* "I love eating oranges"
* "My favorite fruits are oranges and apples"
* "The sky turned orange"

"""## Part III Text classification

This is an example of binary classification on a text dataset.
This is a classification task known as "authorship attribution", which is the task of inferring the author of a document when the authorship is unknown. We will see how accurately this can be done with linear classifiers using word features.

### Tasks
*   For the first classifier, we use any non-deep learning based methods.
*   For the second classifier, try the following methods
    *    Fine-tune BERT (similar to our Lab 5 Fine-tune BERT for Sentiment Analysis)
    *    Use pre-trained word embedding (useful to check: https://keras.io/examples/nlp/pretrained_word_embeddings/)
    *    Train a deep neural network (e.g., CNN, RNN, Bi-LSTM) from scratch, similar to notebooks from our textbook:
        *    https://github.com/the-deep-learners/deep-learning-illustrated/blob/master/notebooks/dense_sentiment_classifier.ipynb
        *    https://github.com/the-deep-learners/deep-learning-illustrated/blob/master/notebooks/convolutional_sentiment_classifier.ipynb
        *    https://github.com/the-deep-learners/deep-learning-illustrated/blob/master/notebooks/rnn_sentiment_classifier.ipynb
        *    https://github.com/the-deep-learners/deep-learning-illustrated/blob/master/notebooks/lstm_sentiment_classifier.ipynb
        *    https://github.com/the-deep-learners/deep-learning-illustrated/blob/master/notebooks/bi_lstm_sentiment_classifier.ipynb
    *   There are also lots of useful resources on Keras website: https://keras.io/examples/nlp/
