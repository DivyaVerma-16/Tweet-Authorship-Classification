## Tweet-Authorship-Classification

## **Overview**   

The task is to develop and compare two **text classification models**:  

1. A **traditional machine learning** approach using **Logistic Regression**  
2. A **deep learning** approach using a **Bidirectional LSTM neural network**  

The goal is to determine whether a given tweet was likely written by **Trump himself (Android device)** or by **his staff (iPhone and other devices)**.  

---

## **Dataset**  
The dataset consists of tweets, labeled as either:  
- **"Android"**   
- **"iPhone"** 

The data is split into **training** and **test sets** for model evaluation.

## **Approaches**  

### **1. Traditional Machine Learning Approach**  
- Uses a **Logistic Regression classifier**  
- Features are derived using **CountVectorizer** for **bag-of-words representation**  

### **2. Deep Learning Approach**  
- Implements a **Bidirectional LSTM neural network**  
- Utilizes **word embeddings** and sequential processing of tweet text

## **Evaluation**  
Both models are evaluated based on their **accuracy** on the test set.  

This project aims to compare the performance of:  
- The **traditional machine learning** approach  
- The **deep learning method**  

for this specific **text classification task**.

## **Significance**  
This project addresses an **interesting question about political communication** and serves as a case study in comparing **traditional vs. modern machine learning techniques** for **text classification**.  

The findings could have implications for:  
- **Authorship attribution** in social media  
- **Political communication strategies**  
- **Machine learning applications in social media analysis**
